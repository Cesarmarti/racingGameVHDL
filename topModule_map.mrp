  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

   merge with F8 mux "Mmux_posP2X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_236_o_10_f8".  The top reasons
   for failure were:
   	-> F8MUX Mmux_posP2X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_236_o_10_f8 can not be placed in the
   F8MUX site because its I0 signal Mmux_posP2X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_236_o_12_f7 can
   not use the output of the F7BMUX. The signal
   Mmux_posP2X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_236_o_15_f72 already uses the F7BMUX.
   	-> F8MUX Mmux_posP2X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_236_o_10_f8 can not be placed in the
   F8MUX site because its I1 signal Mmux_posP2X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_236_o_11_f7 can
   not use the output of the F7AMUX. The signal
   Mmux_posP2X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_236_o_15_f72 already uses the F7AMUX.
   	-> A legal placement was never found for LUT symbol "ramDataO<209>1".
   	-> The F7AMUX Mmux_posP2X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_236_o_12_f7 needs to use a
   route-through LUT but the O6 output of the A LUT is not available.
   	-> The F7AMUX Mmux_posP2X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_236_o_12_f7 needs to use a
   route-through LUT but the O6 output of the B LUT is not available.
   	-> The F7AMUX Mmux_posP2X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_236_o_15_f7_1 needs to use a

   route-through LUT but the O6 output of the C LUT is not available.
   	-> The F7BMUX Mmux_posP2X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_236_o_12_f7 needs to use a

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
