   merge with F8 mux "Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_10_f8".  The top reasons
   for failure were:
   	-> F8MUX Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_10_f8 can not be placed in the F8MUX
   site because its I0 signal Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_12_f7 can not use
   the output of the F7BMUX. The signal Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_15_f72
   already uses the F7BMUX.
   	-> F8MUX Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_10_f8 can not be placed in the F8MUX
   site because its I1 signal Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_11_f7 can not use
   the output of the F7AMUX. The signal Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_15_f72
   already uses the F7AMUX.
   	-> A legal placement was never found for LUT symbol "inst_LPM_MUX1782_SW3".
   	-> The F7AMUX Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_12_f7 needs to use a
   route-through LUT but the O6 output of the A LUT is not available.
   	-> The F7AMUX Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_12_f7 needs to use a
   route-through LUT but the O6 output of the B LUT is not available.
   	-> The F7AMUX Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_15_f7_1 needs to use a
   route-through LUT but the O6 output of the A LUT is not available.

   route-through LUT but the O6 output of the B LUT is not available.
   	-> The F7BMUX Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_12_f7 needs to use a
   route-through LUT but the O6 output of the C LUT is not available.
   	-> The F7BMUX Mmux_posP1X[11]_X_6_o_Mux_60_o_12_f7 needs to use a
   route-through LUT but the O6 output of the D LUT is not available.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
